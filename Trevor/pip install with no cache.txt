pip seems to be installing using cache even with --no-cache-dir. So the versions needed (python 2 version) aren't being installed. Getting f string errors inside the container after build.



# Add --no-cache-dir before install
pip --no-cache-dir install scipy
pip install PACKAGE --no-cache-dir

# could also purge the cache afterwards as a hack
pip cache purge




## to get cache directory: doesnt work too well when in $(), but runs fine as 'pip cache dir' if run directly in terminal
a=$(`echo $(pip cache dir)`)
echo $a





## one approach to not caching files in flask: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34066804/disabling-caching-in-flask
@app.after_request
def add_header(r):
    """
    Add headers to both force latest IE rendering engine or Chrome Frame,
    and also to cache the rendered page for 10 minutes.
    """
    r.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
    r.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
    r.headers["Expires"] = "0"
    r.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'public, max-age=0'
    return r


# another approach to try
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT'] = 0
